HOWTO

To run both jar files you will need to have Java SE Runtime Environment 8 installed on your machine.

NB: You do not have to install and run the server as it is already running on a remote server at:

IP: 139.59.152.110
Port: 1330 

How to install and run the server:
- Download the "chatserver.jar" file from the frontpage
- Double-click the jar file to run the server with default arguments (ip: localhost, port:7777)
- If you want to run the server with different arguments you need to run it through the command line. Open a command prompt and type in "java -jar chatserver.jar <ip> <port>" when you are in the same folder as the jar file.
- The server is now running and can be tested with a client.

How to install and run the client:
- Download the "chatclient.jar" file from the frontpage
- Double-click the jar file to run the client
- The client is now running. To connect to the server you must specify the IP and Port of the server running.
	- IP: 139.59.152.110
	- Port: 1330
- Click on the "Connect" button to connect to the server. You should now be able to send messages to the server.
